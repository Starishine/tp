## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your EduDex.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in,
   and use the `java -jar edudex.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   Note that the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, Block 123, #01-01 d/Wednesday 
      start/15:00 end/16:00`: <br> 
      Adds a student named `John Doe` to EduDex.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list from EduDex.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

---

## MVP Features
**Feature list**:
1. [Add student](#add-student)
2. [Delete student](#delete-student)
3. [View all student contacts](#view-all-student-contacts)
4. [Find student by name or day](#find-student-by-name-or-day)
5. [Exit program](#exit-program)


**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span
  multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

EduDex will display an error message and provide guidance on the correct command format. No data will be changed.
